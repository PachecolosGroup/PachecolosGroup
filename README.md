## 🚀 About Me
Hi, I’m César Bernardo Pacheco Riveras, also known as Pachecolos_group. I’m a passionate front-end developer and UX/UI designer with a knack for crafting visually stunning and user-friendly digital experiences. With a background in graphic design and illustration, I bring a creative edge to every project I tackle.

Over the past five years, I’ve built a solid foundation as a no-code developer and graphic designer, working with platforms like Webflow, WordPress, and Elementor to create responsive, accessible, and high-performance websites. My work merges technical precision, design creativity, and the versatility of no-code tools to deliver exceptional results.

**Now, as a Systems Engineer graduate**, I’m expanding my expertise by diving into the fundamentals of JavaScript to master frameworks and libraries like React, Node.js, Vite, and ultimately Next.js. My goal is to elevate my skills in front-end development, creating interactive web designs and paving the way for mobile app development.

## Technical Skills & Tools
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/html) - The building block of the web. No website can survive without this.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) - The styling language for the web.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Track the history of my projects. It allows me to break things with no worries.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) & [Illustrator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Illustrator-FF9A00?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20illustrator&logoColor=white) - My favorite design tools.
- [ClipStudio Paint](https://www.clipstudio.net/es/) - The best tool to draw.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) - Programming language for everything. 
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor. I love this tool. It has everything that I need to write code.

## 🦣 What I Bring to the Table:
- **Front-End Development:** Expertise in building dynamic and responsive websites with clean, accessible code.
- **UX/UI Design:** Designing intuitive interfaces that prioritize user needs and elevate engagement.
- **Creative Vision:** Incorporating illustration and design to deliver projects that are not only functional but visually captivating.
